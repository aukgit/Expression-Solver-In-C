Expression-Solver-In-C
======================

Expression Solver in C

It was my CSE115 (Introduction to C programming course).

It was a two persons project, the other person never worked on it
because he left the country. As a result , other person never credited
for this project. However name is there as we were assigned.


##Code Credits

Every function is written by Alim Ul Karim. We were asked not use any standard functions. Only one function is used sprintf to convert from char to decimal , other than that every single piece of code is self written. If concept is retrived from some place then cite is given on top of the function(code).

###Duration	
Project was assigned 20 July, 2011 and completly presented on 21 August, 2011.
